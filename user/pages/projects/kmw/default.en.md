The KeinMüllWagen ("no-trash-car") is a 1987 Ford Transit used for transporting materials for Kanthaus, the foodsharing festival season and other upcoming projects. Being an old car, its maintainance is a project in itself allowing caretakers to increase their knowledge about engines, mechanics and welding. The last work on it has been to convert it to use LPG instead of petrol.</p>
