The next [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de) hackweek is due!

The last week of April coders and coderettes are invited to gather at Kanthaus to have a great time with PHP and the foodsharing tech team! It seems to have become tradition that at least once a year there will be a week of focus work on the platform that brought all of us together and we're happy to have you there as well!

You only need to bring yourself, your laptop and whatever it is you can't live without. We provide spaces for working, sleeping, eating and socializing, saved food and drinks, a hot shower and even some clothes and toiletries if you prefer to not carry so much.

The schedule is not yet fixed as it will depend on the participants. General topics are the following:
- Refactoring, refactoring, refactoring - Let's get down to business!
- What has to be done to make foodsharing ready for the future?
- Can Karrot be a useful resource for foodsharing?
- How can we improve our workflows?
- How can we decide more easily which features are okay to implement?
- Improve the documentation and dev experience
- Whatever is on _your_ mind!

Please [write us a mail](mailto:hello@kanthaus.online) if you'd like to participate. We're looking forward to having you!
