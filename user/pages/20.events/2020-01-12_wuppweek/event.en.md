Finally after 2,5 years Kanthaus will have its first real building week :) Together we will prepare the renovation of our roof, prettify some rooms, build a bike trailer or cargo bike, comfort each other with good food or simply tear down some walls :)

You don't need to bring sleeping gear nor tools. Even skills are not necessary to have, we're sure to find them with you! :)

If you can imagine coming, please enter yourself into the [attendance doodle](https://cloud.livingutopia.org/apps/polls/poll/vDdDFFvIrpsa8qBX) and leave us some contact details if we don't already know how to reach you. We will come up with a structure and would like to have a common beggining and introduction, so it would be great if you came on the first day. :)

warmest regards
chandi, bodhi and tilmann
for Kanthaus
