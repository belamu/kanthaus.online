After months of preparation the time has finally come: On April 23rd at 4 pm our very own free shop will have its grand opening!

There will be cake, music and laughter and we hope to see you there!

After this very first occasion the Kanthaus free shop will be open every Tuesday between 4 pm and 6 pm. During that time we will also open our food-share point, as well as our workshops which host the repair cafe and the maker space.

All those things together will make up the newly developed concept of Open Tuesday. Together with the [BUND](https://www.bund.net/) group Wurzen we hope to encourage sharing, repairing and swapping to counter wastefulness.
