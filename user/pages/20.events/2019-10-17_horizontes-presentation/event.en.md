Caroline Schiller who just spent a year working with indigenous people in Colombia shares her experiences and insights based on the example of the NGO [Corporación Horizontes Colombianos](https://horizontes.xyz/en/) (CHC). There is time for discussion afterwards. This lecture is in English.

The presentation shows what goals CHC has, what kind of projects are already running to help indigenous people in Colombia and how you can get involved, too. It gives an overview of the dangerous situation indigenous people find themselves in, especially when they begin to fight for their rights.
