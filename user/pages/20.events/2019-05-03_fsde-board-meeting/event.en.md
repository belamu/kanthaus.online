For the second time this year already the board comes to Kanthaus!

There are structural matters to discuss, about what board work actually means and how it should be tackled in future. New members breathes some fresh air into the team and raises old, big topics again. What even is foodsharing? How do we want to work together? Wich questions are most important?

So as usual there's a lot to talk about and we are extremely happy that we can once again support the board with our infrastructure!
