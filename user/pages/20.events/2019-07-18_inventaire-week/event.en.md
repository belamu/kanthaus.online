[Inventaire](https://inventaire.io) - the free and open source tool to map and share your own personal library - will be at Kanthaus for a week and they want _you_ to join their efforts!

Anyone using or interested in contributing to Inventaire - be it on data, code, design, or communication - is invited for a week of learning, sharing, and contributing!
