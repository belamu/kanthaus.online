We are happy to welcome the board of the federal foodsharing e.V. at Kanthaus!

This year the board meeting will cover topics such as political campaigns, finances, details of online platforms and cooperation management. On top of that there will of course be a retrospective of last year to make sure that successes get deepened and problems can be solved.

Some concrete things to talk about areâ€“
- the email problems, the new navigation on foodsharing.de and accounts on external services used by foodsharing (in the IT section)
- policy decisions and plannings (in the finances department)
- relations to specific chains, the situation in Austria and Switzerland (in the field of cooperations)

Since another [foodsharing hackweek](../2019-02-16_fsde-hackweek) will start just on the same weekend there will probably be loads of occasions for fruitful exchange especially in  the area of platforms and IT.

So as usual there's a lot to talk about and we are extremely happy that we can once again support the board tackling this with our infrastructure!
