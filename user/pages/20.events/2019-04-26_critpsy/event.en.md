After the critical psychology Dresden has founded a new university group almost exactly a year ago, they now come back to Kanthaus!

This time it's about developing the group further, holding workshops and diving deep into the topics of critical psychology together.

We want to question if psychological research and therapy is really objective, how "mainstream psychology" stabilizes societal power structures â€“ and how it impacts our everyday life. But we don't settle for the content, we also criticize the meta level of research, science and university.
