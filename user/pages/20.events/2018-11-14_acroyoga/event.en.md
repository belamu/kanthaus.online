Our [Acroyoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acroyoga) enthusiasts Chandi, Findus and Silvan invite you to come over and enjoy two hours of exercise, contact and fun! If you ever dreamed of flying, this is your chance... ;)

Depending on the size of the group and the mood, we will either stay in the garden or move to a nice spot in the nearby nature.

It doesn't matter if you are a beginner, an amateur or a pro, and you also don't need to worry about a partner. We will work as a group and give everyone the chance to have a good Acroyoga experience.

If you have especially fitting clothing and you don't wanna miss your favorite yoga mat â€“ please bring them! But if you don't have these things we'll be able to manage, too. All you _really_ need to bring is the desire to do some Acroyoga! :)
