This is the last orga meeting that happens before the big event next month.

Quite some people from Kanthaus will take part and many are happy to bring the worlds of [living utopia](http://livingutopia.org/) and [yunity](https://yunity.org) together once more.

Don't miss the great opportunity to try and live your very own utopia by shaping the event itself and come to Harzgerode from July 10 to 14!
