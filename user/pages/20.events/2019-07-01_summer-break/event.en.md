**Open Tuesday, foodsharing leftover brunch and foodsharing Wurzen planning meetings will not take place in all of July and August!**

In July and August there will be so many events in so many different places that Kanthaus will be almost vacant quite often.

**On September 3 we will have a grand reopening. You can expect cake!**

We are heavily involved in the organizing of the three following events which means that they will take up much more time than the indicated core days:
- MOVE Utopia, July 10 to 14 in Harzgerode
- Auerworld Festival, July 26 to 28 in Auerstedt
- foodsharing Festival, August 16 to 18 in Berlin

On top of that there are foodsharing actions to save food and more from many commercial music festivals (e.g. Highfield, Open Flair, Splash and Melt), climate justice actions in PÃ¶delwitz and maybe even some vacation...

For this reason we decided to pause Open Tuesday for all of July and August. The foodsharing leftover brunch and the foodsharing Wurzen planning meetings will not happen during this summer break either.
