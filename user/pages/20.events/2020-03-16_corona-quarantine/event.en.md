We as a Kanthaus community decided to live up to our social responsibility and try to decrease the speed in which COVID-19 spreads.

Even though we are young and healthy and thus not part of the risk group, we can still get infected and infect others. That can happen long before showing symptoms.

That's why we avoid any social contacts and events for now and recommend the sane behavior to other people as well. Not mainly due to fear for ourselves but because of the desire to protect old people and people with pre-existing conditions. The main thing to prevent is a collapse of our health system and we want to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.

Open Tuesday, the foodsharing brunch, the building week and all other events are therefore cancelled as of now and until things calm down.
