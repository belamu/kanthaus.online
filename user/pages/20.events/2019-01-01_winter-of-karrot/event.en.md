After a very successful [Summer of Karrot](/blog/2018-08-06_summer-of-karrot) in July, we continue learning, conceptualizing and coding a progressive web app this January! It's all about enabling real people all across the world to save perfectly fine food from being wasted, about writing good software and about being empowered to create.

The team is the same, the tasks are manifold and Janina, Tais, Tilmann and Nick are equally excited to progress the joint work on [our beloved foodsaving management](https://karrot.world) tool!
