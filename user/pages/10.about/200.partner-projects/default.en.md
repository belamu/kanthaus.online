We have close personal ties to the following projects which also share a lot - if not all - of our ideals:

### Freie Feldlage in Harzgerode

The former children's clinic in the Harz mountains is a place full of opportunity. The huge area with its hospital buildings, forests and meadows offers as many tasks as it provides freedom. Many of us spent months there before Kanthaus even started and especially in summer it still is the place to be for those of us who prefer nature over city life.

### Funkenhaus in Greene

One year younger than Kanthaus but probably much more known Funkenhaus (formerly called 'Kollektivhaus') is like a sibling project to us. It emerged from the [living utopia](https://livingutopia.org) network which is a major player in the transformative scene of Germany. Our contact to this network goes back to [yunity](https://yunity.org) days for some and even further for others.
