## People

- interested in working on the house itself (construction, decoration, maintenance)
- interested in helping with existing or emerging projects we have (foodsharing, repair cafe)
- interested in progressing own projects in or with the house (especially those that have an external effect)

## Stuff

Following our vision we try to reuse things that are lying around somewhere because they are not wanted or needed. If you have things like that we might be interested. However, maintaining a list separately in two languages proved too much of a hassle and resulted in divergence multiple times. That's why we decided to only carry on with the German version of this page. Cause let's be honest: if you're English-speaking chances are high that you have a pretty long way to us and then it's fine if you don't bring all your old things... ;)
