<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

##### Expenses
<!-- Encourage people to enter their expenditures from Kanthaus money -->


##### Income
<!-- Check the shoe in K20-0 (base is 30 €) and the donation box in the free shop in K22-0-3 -->



##### Team updates
<!-- Project managers from teams defined during the MCM should report about the current situation -->
- Roof (Silvan, Tilmann):
- Stuff (Bodhi, Matthias, Thore):
    - some stuff was cleared out of the intermediate storage
- Rooms (Janina, Nathalie):
    - Bodhi wants to transform the intermediate storage room into a sorting room
    - Progressing the K22 basement food storage would be awesome - does Thore still feel responsible? Would he be okay with someone else taking over?
    - more private storage space seems needed - extend the private stuff isle in the communal closet?
    - the futon office might be progressed soon as more people get interested in creating and using it
    - are three offices too many or does it make sense to have them all? which ones to heat during winter?

- [janina] which rooms to heat this week? who wants to use which office space?
    - office and silent office will definitely be heated, futon office maybe
    - some rooms should be heated a bit to prevent mold (e.g. snack kitchen, elephant room, bathroom)
    - maybe keep some more windowsills clear, but there are not so many other places for plants
    - more ventilation! open windows
- [Silvan] Would we like to have one/two Sprossenwände in the YogaRoom?
