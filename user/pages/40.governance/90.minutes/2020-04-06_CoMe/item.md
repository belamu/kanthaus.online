<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, solar intake, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!) 
  - Maybe these notes helps you to do it by your own: Github-Link: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/tree/master/user/pages/40.governance/90.minutes Steps: 1) Click "Create new file" 2) Type as Name "year-months-day_CoMe/item.md" example: 2020-03-02_CoMe/item.md 3) Copy CoMe-minutes from the "Bearbeiten Modus" (black window) 4) Click "Commit changes" That´s it! After a few minutes the CoMe-minutes should appear on the website.     
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

##### Daily averages for last week
<!-- Read counters in heating room and append to water.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146415 and gas.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146411. Strongly knock against the display of the solar inverter in K20 Basement material storage and put the E-Total kWh in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146414 solar.csv, take the difference between your and the last value and multiply it with 0.285 €/kWh to have the solar intake. update the residence record (https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/blob/master/residenceRecord.csv) otherwise the script will complain -->

### 4. Announcements
<!-- Were there any changes to governance? -->
- [matthias] ~~We have a Bauhelferunfallversicherung for 6 people now. Costed ~360€, lasts until 2022-04-01 11:59~~ some delays with the Bauhelferunfallversicherung, Claras mum keeps us updated and alternatively we chose another, similar contract. Might take a few days before we finally have it.
- [Janina] The 60°C laundry from the baby bathroom rarely gets full until we need to wash it. It's the diapers that had poo contact. If you don't mind having private things of yours washed together with this, please put them in the 60° laundry basket in the baby bathroom.
- [Matthias] Wood in the woodshed is always put against the back of the shelves so you can easily see all dimensions of a piece.
- [Doug] lost my Keys: 2 keys, small light and memory stick. Anyone seen that? (Hands up) otherwise leave on my desk, food shelf, etc.

### 5. Shopping plans
- Vinegar (Naturtrüb) for creating a vinegar-mother, from Kräuterfee or ready vinegar mother if she has one, should be <10€

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Matthias, Janina] Shall we have a BBQ party that integrates a knowledge sharing about how to set up the mixer? It would cover 'how to power hour radio' but in the garden. It might be followed by a silent-disco (stops at 10 :) )
  - Yay, let's do it! :D
- [Doug] change default knowledge sharing time to 16:00?
  - Accepted
- [Tilmann] try warm communal lunch instead of warm dinner? (big meal is not directly before sleeping, leftovers can be eaten at dinner, solar power for cooking)
  - Seems worth trying. How about try it out for a week and then see if we want to continue it?
  - Good time could be between 1 and 2 pm.
  - Hash out details this week and start next week with trying.
- [Anja] Never put colorful coated paper in the compost bins please! If there is a need for more newspaper we should find some.
  - Is the stuff biodegradable and soaking? Seems not to fit for the compost heap.
  - There's some more newspaper in the snack kitchen, and also this endless printing paper seems appropriate to use.
  - If people find newspaper somewhere where it's not needed, bring it!
- [Doug] small things I think we should try and stop 1) people leaving tiny amounts of food 2) people leaving completely empty packets 3) obstruction of garden path 4) people leaving empty teekanne where full ones should be.
  - [Doug] generally. Accepted. Janina/Matthias add that rinsing/removing empty bags before storage is good.
- [Matthias] Turn off heating system from today on - resistance? Please take care to keep heat inside:
  - Still ventilate as it is winter in the morning/evening: Keep as much heat inside as possible
  - Open windows during hot times (~12.00-18.00)
  - In the evening, although the sun shines into the window, air outside is often colder than inside -> keep windows closed again :-)
- [Janina] What is the situation with the garden? Shall we make a communal action to tidy it up?
  - [Bodhi] Everything that's still on the lawn from odering the wood shed can be put somewhere until 3 pm today can be seen as trash.
  - [Doug] Let's have a garden power hour from 2 to 3 pm and sort out everything together before the BBQ party! 
- [Matthias] Is there interest in a session about music recording?
  - Yes there is (Clara, Janina, Maxime, Nathalie)! So there might be something hapopening in the next weeks.
- [Thore] foodsharing Mitbring-Brunch/easter breakfast per video call?
  - Sounds cool, let's do it!
  - [Nathalie] Thore and I will think about the setup and then post something.
- [Silvan] findus Mail WWF?
  - More information is needed. Clara takes care of it.
- [Zui] Can I join in social sauna this week?
  - [Clara] The situation now is different from the normal: All visitors are here for a quite long time and will stay a while. I think it would be cool if they could join because they are part of the house already.
  - [Nathalie] I agree and I feel different about visitors who already had an evaluation and are reaccepted than about day guests.
  - We will discuss this in #kh_vol_and_mem and tell you tomorrow
- [Maxime] Dinner lottery meta point
  - Shall we intervene on a software level if some people are cooking several weeks in a row and some never?
  - Well they can just opt out / volunteer. No need to make changes to the software.
- [Doug] Projektschmiede meetin g this week?
  - Postponed
