<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

        * pro [Demeter](https://www.demeter.de/sites/default/files/richtlinien/richtlinien_7-allgemeine-regelungen-erzeugung.pdf)
            - no spinosad (insecticide, quite toxic against honeybees) used
            - no fertilizer based on slaughterhouse by-products used
            - whole farm (not just a product) fullfills the demeter principles

    - some calculations
        - we need approximately 1 liter of sunflower/rapeseed oil per week, with 4.3 weeks/month:
            * Non Bio/Discounter: 4,26€/month
            * EU Bio: 14,19€/month
            * Demeter: 33,45€/month
    - Olive oil will be bought in Demeter quality. Usage will be monitored for future estimations.
    - Sunflower / rapeseed oil discussion delayed because it got too lengthy.
    - There will be a pad where people can collect their research.
- [lise] Nia from Pödelwitz asks, if it's possible to use Wandel Würzen e.V. for a funding application. They want to build up a community garden and need some things for that. I'd be happy if we support it :) She needs an answer soon.
    - We still have a lot unclarity about our own finances, there are concerns to make our association available for other people's funding again. We need more information.
    - People who want to use our asso should join it.
    - Findus will call Nia again to gather more information.
- [Lise, Clara] a woman from Wurzen asked if we want to have a bed like the single bed in the sleep kitchen. She comes again sometime this week.
    - We don't want it. If she comes back we'll tell her.
- [Nathalie] Workaway request Eva
    - Nathalie will write her.
- [Nathalie] Foodsharing board meeting: Stefan would like a private room and warm water
    - We give the private sleeping room to him and explain the battery light.
- [Janina] Daily backup dumpster diving people?
    - Concern: Maybe we shouldn't replace motivation by coercion. Maybe the problem is somewhere else
    - If we have more frequent communal dinners the topic will probably come up more easily.
    - More comfortable bikes with hinges for trailers would also raise motivation for some.
- Sommerfest: Confusion about the date. 8.6. is Pfingsten (Holiday), 15.6. some people don't have time. Mini-Meeting tomorrow, 11.00

### 7. For next week
- [Matthias] Presentation on billing
- Monday: Silvan's evaluation
