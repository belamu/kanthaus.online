<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) <!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- Instantlink donation confusion
- Roof repairs - small
  - Doug: Do we have all the material to make emergency roof repairs if needed?
  - Matthias: A part of the burner is missing, all the rest is here. But there's other burners, so theoretically we could do roof repairs tomorrow.
  - Doug: Might be worth it doing it before spring. I'll keep on monitoring the rain situation and might take action if necessary.
  - Bodhi&Matthias: We'd be happy to help.
- Roof replacement - big
  - Bodhi: Yesterday we talked with Tilmann about this and found that May-June would be a good time for big roof repairs.
  - Matthias: So should we schedule a planning meeting or is it too early? It doesn't _need_ to happen soon...
  - Doug&Janina: It _should_ happen next year!
  - Matthias: Let's talk about it in the next CoMe.
- Stand Grundstücksverschmelzung
  - Matthias: No progress since last time. It probably needs talking to one of the involved external parties again...
- Stand PV-Einspeiseerlaubnis
  - we either need a registered electrician or we try to register ourselves
  - Matthias will email Daniel again
- Progress with the funding we got
  - Bodhi sent the documents they wanted and now we just wait for the money. :D
  - Janina would like to help with documentation.
  - Doug saw a 2nd hand battery store in Chemnitz and could imagine collaboration possibilities: http://www.akkuman-chemnitz.de/
- brief talk about safely storing the lithium batteries
- talks about our internet contact/connection and its future. Matthias and Bodhi will stay on it and find a good solution.
