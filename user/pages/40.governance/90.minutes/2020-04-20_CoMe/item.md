<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, solar intake, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - Maybe these notes helps you to do it by your own: Github-Link: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/tree/master/user/pages/40.governance/90.minutes Steps: 1) Click "Create new file" 2) Type as Name "year-months-day_CoMe/item.md" example: 2020-03-02_CoMe/item.md 3) Copy CoMe-minutes from the "Bearbeiten Modus" (black window) 4) Click "Commit changes" That´s it! After a few minutes the CoMe-minutes should appear on the website.
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Check the shoe!
  - Have fun!

### 1. Last week review

##### Daily averages for last week
<!-- Read counters in heating room and append to water.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146415 and gas.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146411. Strongly knock against the display of the solar inverter in K20 Basement material storage and put the E-Total kWh in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146414 solar.csv, take the difference between your and the last value and multiply it with 0.285 €/kWh and divide by 7 days to have the solar intake per day. update the residence record (https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/blob/master/residenceRecord.csv) otherwise the script will complain -->
<!-- press the play button on https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-governance/pipeline_schedules and it will print to

- 226€

##### Team updates
<!-- Project managers from teams defined during the MCM should report about the current situation -->

- Roof (Silvan, Tilmann):
  - discovered lots of questionable walls in K20, Statiker contacted; one other option considered that turned out infeasible
  - made a plan for K22 attic reinforcements that will most likely work; it would mean adding a beam on the yoga room ceiling. still need to resolve a problem with window vs beam position though. Would like more opinions or concerns (see #kanthaus-dach)
  - roof support meeting happened

- Stuff (Bodhi, Matthias, Thore, Chandi):

- Rooms (Nathalie, Janina):
  - free shop lounge: a team is forming who takes care of it. initial meeting today after CoMe
  - Janina and Lise had a casual meeting about functions of bedrooms and indicators and will post the minutes in the next days for people to give feedback.
  - Komposttoilet improvements: falling-shaft cleaned, piece of plasic to stop toilet paper from sticking, pushed pile and spread evenly, composting seems to be fine, capacity should last another 2-3 months before has to be emptied (as planned). switch installed propperly :) experimental butt-towel holder installed. water tap shortened.

##### Other things that happened
- Silvan built a shelve with 6 boards in the office
- a bathtub became a highbed and the garden got filled with great soil
- many seedlings were planted outside and some will be ready to get harvested soon!
- Anja gave away many tomato plants and got a few fancy tomato plants in exchange

### 4. Announcements
<!-- Were there any changes to governance? -->

- [Anja] There is a Maskenpflicht in Saxony from today on for going shopping or using public transport
- [Janina] Mika now eats two jars of the Hipp Grießbrei per day. Me and Tilmann would appreciate keeping it for him if people are okay with that.
- [tilmann] light storm warning today, let's check the roof cover right after CoMe
- [Lise] In the last sharing event some topics came up which could be interesting for more talks and sharing rounds. See #kanthaus
- [Matthias] Please participate in online discussion about bathroom walls: https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1587162158023200
- [Matthias] Please participate in online discussion about more garden shed space: https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1587212675027600
- [Anja] a lot (~8 boxes) of yummy food wants to be washed soon!
- [Anja] Getting active: Unload the KMW after CoMe - who wants to help? (takes ~15min)
- [Silvan] We build up the massage bed in the yoga room. Will take it down in a maybe one week, so feel free to use it!
- [Janina] I restarted morning and evening hugs, please tell or show if you don't want to be hugged (and ask before you hug a person where you are not sure)

### 5. Shopping plans
- [doug] Cable Finder, ~15€ https://www.ebay.de/itm/3-in-1-Stud-Finder-Metalldetektor-Leitungssucher-Kabelfinder-Metall-Wand-Scanner/402166971116?hash=item5da304faec:m:mzlQxfVJVa9SYJ_gimL1hVA (because it's not 100 % clear where wires are, and empowers people who don't have 'the sense')
  - Research on if they work on possible unpowered aluminium cables (and if we even care about those)
      - "Metal Scan Mode: locates the metal such as iron, copper and aluminum pipe up to 3 inch (76mm)"
        - cool!
  - Additionally, matthias is always happy to be asked if there needs to be care drilling into a certain piece of wall (can give additional hint on the potential wall quality)
  - go ahead
- [Clara] Cumin seeds

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [clara] Call with Antonia from WWF. She will send us questions. This is an article about Funkenhaus (https://www.wwf-jugend.de/blogs/5532/8363/ein-haus-der-utopie) but ours would be more like an interview
- [Clara] Video for the Linke, Resistance?
- [maxime] dandelions are sprouting in the garden, [we could do stuffs with it](https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/benefits-of-dandelion-greens-zmaz08amzmcc)
  - Would be cool to keep them in our garden for bees
  - Lise wants to get rid of the ones in her garden, go dig them out :)
- [Matthias] Meal preparation this week https://codi.kanthaus.online/lunch-lottery-retrospective
  - People expressed resistance doing the lunch lottery forever
  - Proposal is to just extend lunch lottery for another week -> so be it.
  - Suggestion to have a clarifying meeting this week earlier.
- {to be removed} [Doug] Attic Durchbruch. Help needed to get door. If second hand not findable, are we happy to spend €150 to get new one?
  - [Matthias] I think we don't need door very soon. Also, I wonder if we might want to have a different kind of door...
  - Suggestion of making the hole in the size for smaller door with possibility to extend it later
    - (Sturz-Details might be interesting in that case, let's discuss online)
- [Anja] Doug and I want to research/experiment with growing veggies indoor in a bottle (inspired by https://bottlecrop.com/) who's interested in joining us? We might start this week.
- [Doug] I would like 'finishing' work to be reasonably factored into new construction works, even if it's not planned to do them straight away. (Related to the bathroom case, generalized).
- [Anja] Since demand on face-masks rises, I will sew many more. I'm very happy about help (mainly cutting and sewing if you feel able to set up another sewing machine)
- [matthias] where to pee in the garden
  - Anja would like to limit pee areas to the compost area

### 8. For next week
