<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. You can copy&paste the template https://codi.kanthaus.online/come-template?edit (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Changes to Governance
- none

### 7. Expense Requests
- none


### 8. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [lise] In the social sauna we thought about redesigning come. We agreed, that CoMe is not the place for discussions, but for notifying people about ongoing discussions. Proposals:
   - Let's use this section "discussion" to see who will be in the subgroup & they'll find a meeting.
   - Decisions only for things which are obviously okay for everyone
   - Limited number of points per person
   - Remove sections
   - Implement timekeeper (points have limited time)
   - not a place for emotional topics
   - [clara] I didn't participate in the discussion, but I actually quite like the format at the CoMe and of allowing "short" discussions which- if it's evident that there is more need to continue the discussion - can be continued after CoMe. It's easier to know how much need there is for discussion if there is at least a short dicussion before, where some impressions are caught. But maybe this is what you meant? 
   - [matthias] Whenever I try to put discussions on slack instead of come, I have the perception of getting 0 comments for ~50% of the points whereby in CoMe it is easier to get the feeling of the group. I am in for a time limit - but also have the feeling, we manage quite good with CoMe in the last months.
   - Sub-group: Tilmann, Doug, Lise, Thore
- [findus] moi not there so much, is that ok, or should I just stay away?
    - people can ask findus or write on slack
- [franziska] is it ok to still be here on the week-end?
    - doug will ask in the vol- and members channel
- [bodhi] new space in communal closet, and maybe reassign
    
### 9. Dinner lottery/food recommendation

### 10. For next week
