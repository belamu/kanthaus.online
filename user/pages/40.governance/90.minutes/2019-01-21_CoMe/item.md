<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) <!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- Doug: request to not use books for raising things. Non-urgent, but before roadmap nice. (Silvan monitor in office, monitor/s in silent)
  - Janina: Agree! What to use instead?
  - Doug: We have paving stones, but those would need to have fabric covers to protect table/equipment.
- could we install a light in the entrance of K20? Its very dark there around 16:00 and the movement sensor doesn't do anything.
  - Janina: I'm generally in favor of having the motion sensors trigger a bit earlier (meaning with a bit more surrounding light). So not only in the foyer but in the upper staircase toilet as well.
  - Matthias: For the toilet you need to resolder a resistor, for the foyer it needs a software update.
  - Chandi: Could that software update work as a tutorial? Cause I'd very much like to get more into this housebus stuff.
  - Matthias: Maybe we can schedule something towards the end of the week.
  - Answer: Everyone's happy to have extra light but when and how is unclear, since there are no immediate volunteers.
- Doug: medicine currently sorted alphabetically by proprietary name :( Does anyone have resistance to me organizing by categories
  - Janina: Please do! But what about the airtable then..? ;) We can have a funeral xDD ✝
  - Matthias: Slight concerns that the categories won't be clear. Would like to find a medicine by name still.
  - Bodhi: Would be nice to still be able to search through all the medication digitally
  - Doug: I'll think of some concrete proposal and will present next week.
- Doug: Winter roadmap ends 28th February: what's your issue status?
- Doug: someone(s) keeps leaving their plate/cutlery/cup/glass on above the dishwasher. Could they please put it directly in?
  - Matthias, Bodhi, Janina: We sometimes do it and are also happy to do the small task of putting it inside.
  - Lise, Doug: We are quite annoyed by dirty dishes on the snack kitchen table.
  - Maybe it's just a problem of space? Could be solved by making more space for dirty dishes in the snack kitchen. But bigger changes on the room layout seem unnecessary work since rooms will be moved in the not so far future anyways.
  - Good enough for this week, let's see how this continues...^^
- Doug: invites Matthias to clear/clean KMW with him :)
  - Will be done today!
- Doug: does anyone not have access to nextcloud calendar that wants? Does anyone want help to sync to laptop/phone?
  - Clara is interested
- bodhi: schedule moving the basement stuff storage (1-2h action with many people)
- bodhi: luisa would be very happy to moderate a "shared economy session" with us or give input on the topic during the month of calm. do we want this?
  - She has time on 3rd, 7th or 14th. -> 3rd sounds good!
- Lise: Pickup of sofa and desk

### 7. For next week
- Luisa's facilitation of a shared economy session on the 3rd
- Lise's backstory on some evening or afternoon
