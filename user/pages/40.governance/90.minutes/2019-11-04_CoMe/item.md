<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- [Michal] talk about his recent experience, and maybe his more distant one with working for money in KH (schedule)
- [Doug] Propose we heat like last year: heat office and living room always to 18°C, from 08:00 to 23:00 and partial heating of bathroom and snack kitchen (other rooms heated with awareness)
    - People seem generally happy with that.
    - The fishbowl resulted in us wanting to add another come section on heating - so this topic will come back ;)
- [lise] winter is coming and Christmas as well! Lise will put out the Adventskalender for this year and remind people in November to fill it.
    - [Nathalie] will find and install it
- [Doug] https://codi.kanthaus.online/gas Decide on EWS gas and if we want to ask for a discount.
    - people interested should look at the pad and then discuss, decision next come?!
    - [Doug] Who is taking this topic on? Nathalie, sort of.
- [matthias] buy more smoke detectors. Outcome of Slack Discussion?
    - [doug] infosec issues regarding 'smart' detectors?
    - https://app.slack.com/client/T0B6WCFM5/C3RS56Z38/thread/C3RS56Z38-1572288210.072100
- [Doug] Rear bike light got stolen within 12 hours of being parked in Leipzig :( 
- [Doug] Electric wires. Are any live ones (still) exposed? Would we like to have a policy of no exposed wires for future projects?
    - there are some locations in the house where live wires are exposed.
    - [matthias] heat dissipation must be considered when covering heat-producing electronics.
    - [matthias, tilmann, chandi] currently exposed wires are only in low-risk areas.
    - [doug] 'not exposed' meaning 'not possible to access with finger'
    - [nathalie] It's uncomfortable especially for guests to see danger signs everywhere.
    - [doug] I will push on this topic and also help implement a solution.
- [michal] Would like to try 2 (maybe regular/weekly) activities and wants to scan peoples' interest:
    - making music together
    - evening reading of (Moomins)
    - people are interested, Michal will find dates and invite again
- [Doug] Idea: Kanthaus 'pfand'. For items we don't want to give away, but have an immediate excess of (i.e. bike pumps)
    - [matthias] all the big bike pumps except the yellow are crappy, feel free to give them away)
    - [matthias] this fits the concept of 'moving materials' - it's a system in the making.
- [Nathalie] who is caring for the Residence Record?
    - [Janina] can do it again

### 7. Dinner lottery
<!-- To be done on the physical board -->

### 8. For next week
- Moving materials update [Chandi, Matthias?]
