<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

#### To schedule

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- The sidewalk looks not good (and is smelly). How about cleaning it?
    - Sounds good! Maybe even today?
    - And removing the huge weeds in front of K18? Only if we document it and send pictures to the actual owner...
- Silvan would like to host the Auerworld after meeting here on October 4-6. That would include ~20 people.
    - There are concerns how fitting Kanthaus would be for the group (because of size and some people).
    - Sleeping arrangements would probably be difficult. How many privates would be needed?
    - What are other possible locations for the Auerworld meeting?
- Ukuvote for timing the month of introspection in 2020 is on! Proposal phase until Wednesday afternoon, then voting phase for another 7 days!

### 7. Water/Dinner lottery
