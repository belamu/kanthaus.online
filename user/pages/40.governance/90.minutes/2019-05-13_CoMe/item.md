<!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- [Janina] Unwashed food (e.g. from the market pickup or quite clean dded food that is better not to be washed in advance) is stored in front of the lower staircase toilet right now. Shall we continue doing this and maybe add a sign there?
    - General agreement
    - Two different categories that should be kept in different crates: dded unwashed food vs. foodshared unwashed food
    - We need to make signs accordingly.
- [Matthias] Roof proposals written down with a bit more detail. Please read through/discuss/comment before we start a formal decision making in a few days. (see this already as the proposal phase) https://codi.im.kanthaus.online/entscheidungsgrundlage_dach#
- [Matthias] Washing machine has a **manual door lock**. Please make sure to close & lock the door before it is running, it does not automatically detect when the door is open and will start in any case.
- [Nathalie] Workaway guests announcement: Eva will come for a week after June 8.
- [Tilmann] The apple tree needs lots of water right now. Today especially it can use a bucket of water every hour.
