<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 5. Announcements
<!-- Information & things that "aren't debateable". Only clarifying questions -->
- [bodhi] plans a sperrmüll and builing ruble trip this week

### 6. Changes to Governance

### 7. Expense Requests

### 8. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [lise] Instead of Evaluation another sharing circle about Mika in Kanthaus?
    - general opinion: good idea! people like that
    - lets schedule it next week when lise, tilmann and janina are back
- [Doug] Proposal, amendment to constitution re. age of 'independence'. Backers? https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/compare/const_dependents_doug_2019-11-23 Would start this week.
    - [chandi] would not like to have it fixed on a specific age
- [lise] There is still the opportunity to present Wandel Würzen e.V. / Kanthaus at the christmas market in Wurzen. Associations are asked to use one of the sheds there to present themselves.  The shed is voll ausgestattet and has a Glühweindurchlauferhitzer. All income from sold stuff can be taken by the association. Anybody interested? I can imagine it quite nice. Maybe without selling stuff, but with a donation box or just with the free-shop moved there? As kind of a christmas edition of open tuesday? A free slot would be on 15.12. I'd like to answer Fr. Hanspach very soon.
    - [bodhi] would be interested in putting stuff through the durchlauferhitzer and giving it to people
    - [doug] can help carring stuff and drinking glühwein
    - [bodhi] some concernes about giving alcohol.
    - [nathalie] and [maxime] would also help a bit
    - [nathalie] gets in touch with lise
- [Doug] Proposal: attic vacuum cleaner. I think it makes sense to get one. We have 4, all in use. Get one free/cheap OR get a good one and replace the worst one.
    - [bodhi, matthias] concerns from the dust released by vacuuming
    - [Doug] doesn't see more realistic option. Feels blocked.
- [Nathalie] foodsharing Festival meeting from 24.-26.01.2020 in Kanthaus. Concerns? It's the weekend between wupp week and month of calm
    - no concerns
- [chandi] electricity usage too high?
    - [matthias] quick analysis of oct-dez 2019 vs oct-dez 2018: ~2x the electricity usage vs ~1.2x the people
    - [matthias] Hotter showering, Tumble dryer, electric cooking vs. gas earlier
- [bodhi] what to do with spices that had moths before
    - [chandi] concernes for deciding now once for all future people
    - [clara] proposes having it seperated as "moth spice"
    - [doug] did anyone some research? tilmann tried, but failed
    - [bodhi] would be a lot more relaxed, if he doesn't have do decide all the time
    - [doug] proposal: give moth spices to tilmann and we buy new spices when we order next time
- [bodhi] ews gas. doug did some research
    - [bodhi] rather use non-eco EWS Erdgas than what we have now (enso) for about the same price
    - there are further discussions needed. we schedule it next week
- [matthias] light decoration on the house?
    - putting up some nice, non-christmas-related lighting on the outside of the house
    - maybe even something bigger on K20-2 facing to the Dresdner Straße?
    - no further concernes for non-christmas lights

- [Doug] stuff requests:
    - to label every printer in the shelf outside the office that you want to keep @silvan @bodhi
        - [matthias] would be able to decide, since he knows silvans preferences
    - to have a deadline for the MOVE stuff in the intermediate storage room @chandi @findus
        - communized!
    - to only keep working bikes in the bike shed & move rest to attic @silvan @?
        - [matthias] Thore and me moved all broken bicycles to the attic 3 months ago, suggest to have this a default :)


### 9. Dinner lottery/food recommendation

### 10. For next week
- [toBeScheduled] Revolution Knowledge Presentation [findus]
