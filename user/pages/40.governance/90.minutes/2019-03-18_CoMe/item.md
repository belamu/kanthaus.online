<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

#### To schedule


### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) <!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- [lise] lets make the sharing event a fixed date!
    - decision: mondays 16:00, beginning in the next week
- [matthias] let's make the power hour 2 hours long - a lot of teams need 1.5 hours or more, would make the frame a bit clearer and maybe makes people pick a second task when they are done after 45 minutes otherwise. 
    - [tilmann] I wonder if we can sustain the energy needed for that. Would rather try to focus on the most important parts and keep it to one hour.
    - to make the actual-needed time more visible: 10-11:30
- [Laurina] any resistance to kanthaus being part of the verband freier Bildungsalternativen? See Laurinas post in #kanthaus https://yunity.slack.com/archives/C3RS56Z38/p1552670199125800 (https://www.freiebildungsalternativen.de/kanthaus/)
    - [tilmann] what does it mean?Do we have to do stuff, engage or are we just listed as a place...?
    - why are we listed there before we were asked? ask Laurina to remove it from their website before we have the discussion in kanthaus
    - people who are interested to discuss: chandi, Lise
- [Lise] Group room usage on the weekend was not ideal, Personal stuff was in private rooms all the times. How can we improve this, why did that happen? 
    - [tilmann] K22 is quite far from any storage possibilities; more storage next to the rooms might be useful
    - matthias did no in depth explanation of house & usage of private rooms, because most people / contact people were here before. maybe communication in the group was not ideal? should the host be more aware?
    - [chandi] improve signs
- [matthias] Feedback to und jetzt group?
    - how did other people felt during / after the weekend? matthias is a bit unhappy about agreements not fulfilled
    - doing dumpster washing / diving, offering help, passing on information didn't work, ...
    - [chandi] retrospective with group would have been good?
    - [matthias] not sure if he was a good host? he will write to Katharina for feedback. if you have anything to add, speak to him
- [matthias] benji
    - he will come tuesdays-fridays 9-3 / 10-4
    - we are looking for activities for him
    - currently he does stuff in the staircase, maybe he can help removing plaster in basement
    - matthias is currently most responsible, but leaves this week and will hand the responsibility over to interested people
- [matthias] mail from Kima Project Villa (Sozialstunden)
    - two teenagers have to do social work hours (50hours & 15hours)
    - do we have work for them?!
    - [nathalie] do social work hours fit to the house? we should have a clearer point to that topic
        - people who are interested find it each other and talk about that!
- [matthias] janina hosting felix and flo okay? (I could host felix)
- [matthias] mail laden/coordnation foodsharing camera interview 
    - they asked us to give an interview in the beginning of the year
    - janina?
- [matthias] mail request Reiseuni in april, 15-20 ppl, 7 days
    - not many people in the house during that time
    - Who would be up for hosting?(Lise will ask around)
    - https://yunity.slack.com/archives/G7E8RPFMH/p1552420723000700
- [tilmann] hausmüll (black bin) can go out today - let's fill it up?
    - lise and bodhi will fill it up
- [nathalie] workaway-profile
    - bodhi will talk to her how his experiences were with workaway in kanthaus
