<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun! -->

### 6. Food planning
<!-- originally this was meant as a slot do find a common opinion of „how often should be cooked this week?“  -->
- Skipped

### 7. Heating planning
- everything like last week, minor adjustments as we go

### 8. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)

- Doug: Please use the nextcloud calendar when organising events. (Perhaps the duty of CoMe note-taker?)
  - Janina: Which calendar? Nextcloud? The wooden pinboard? Both..?
  - Janina: I think both makes sense here and both should be updated during CoMe. Preferably by two people simultaneously
  - Doug: both preferable, but I would encourage digital priority. (Task for me: put sign on pin board to remind people to add to nextcloud)
  - Tilmann: keep calendars focused, needs cleanup. Problem: most calendars are not enabled by default, needs additional setup for first timers
  - Tilmann: all events should be created on the the physical calendar as well, otherwise they're not accessible for Visitors
- Silvan: PR material for the short film festival will arrive in the next days. Please take care of distributing it if I'm already gone by then.
- Doug: Has everyone that wanted to make Roadmap issues done so yet?
  - Tilmann: Minutes are published already, [please update them when you create new issues](https://kanthaus.online/de/governance/minutes/2018-12-08_roadmap) (edit link is at bottom)
- Doug: When leaving a room, ask yourself if there's something useful you can take with you!
- Matthias: Question from Move to use wandel würzen for some funding applications for the move. Potential conflicts: a) Kleinunternehmerregelung (but likely not), b) we cannot use those fundings for us in the time. (GLS, Aktion Mensch Förderaktion „Noch viel mehr vor“)
  - Silvan: Ginge das laut Satzung? (Vereinszweck), Um welche Summen ginge es da?
  - Doug: based on what I know about our financial situation, I wouldn't give money to other associations at this point.
    - Tilmann: I think they are going to apply for funds, but the funds are not going to us
- Janina: Two of my friends will arrive on Friday, one of which just finished his studies. We'll have a drinking party, where should we do it so it doesn't bother anyone? How much of the communal beer can we drink or shall we go out and buy some from the beginning?
  - Silvan: So the primary purpose is drinking? That would be against the Collective Agreements.
  - Matthias: Reading it the way it is phrased I have strong concerns, but I'll also not be here at the time, so do what you want. My concerns are not about the alcohol itself, but rather about supporting something like this at Kanthaus.
  - Tilmann: It is not something I want to support at Kanthaus. It would be better to not do it here, but if there's no other suitable solution it might be okay this one time.
  - Janina: I never intended to make this a regular event or anything. The primary purpose is not drinking in general, but being together and yes, drinking some alcoholic drinks. It's mostly a private visit for celebration and catching up, I only wanted to be completely transparent. (I probably shouldn't have phrased it so intensely... ^\_^')

### 9. For next week

- Doug: I have a growing need to keep some clothes private. Washing them with collective clothes is difficult. Who else washes/would like to wash things privately? Is there enough demand to justify having a basket for private laundry?
