<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

#### To schedule

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) 
<!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->

- [nathalie]: talk about repair-cafe/ fairteiler next weeks because many people left. update calendar in the info-box ("Schaukasten") see: https://cloud.kanthaus.online/s/A6CDnDrKizJ9Hfj
    - nathalie prints calendars for the info-box 
    - we continue doing both
- [nathalie]: presentation of open-tuesday concept. freeshop opening 23th april!
    - everything will happen from 4 to 6 pm
    - more "café style" (e.g. serving tea)
    - at least 3 people vonlunteering for that would be great
    - Janina is head of PR
    - Mass flyering action :) 
- [doug]: Almost ~20 logos :) Voting starts after CoMe until next week. Consider reading and adding to the discussion pad.
- [doug]: You can embed images from Nexctloud by adding `preview/` to the end of the share link. Video in #kantkunst
- [clara]: Basisförderung Bewegungsstiftung - Would that be of interest to Kanthaus? If yes, I can find out more. Application Deadline is 2nd of April.
    - lets' find out more!
    - seems to be cool
- [janina]: There's choir stammtisch tonight! Some of them wanted to come by for a while now, this is a good opportunity to talk about this - and for the funding support list.
    - [janina] I would wait until Lise is back
    - [doug] Lets do it right after the PowerHour, so it's cleanest :)
    - no resistance
- [nathalie]: foodsharing board meeting 02.05 - 05.05 (already in calendar, I can host)
- [doug]: inventaire hackathon
    - possibly happens in July
    - Doug expresses his appreciation for the project
- [doug]: reading records - boring?
    - [Tilmann]: tell a story
    - [chandi]: proposal: only reading out efficiencies
- [michal]: dinner at 6 short reflection
    - [round] nobody hated it, people liked having more time in the evening but with cake in the afternoon it was too early
    - a regular time is appreciated
    - it doesn't have to be binary, how about a time frame like 'dinner between 6 and 7'?
    - we can have more trial phases and generally the people who are there should decide
    - quick vote:
        - 6 => 4
        - 6:30 => 12
        - 6-7  => 3
        - 6:30-7 => 7 
    - Decision: dinnner at 6:30 for this week
