<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- [Janina] It really annoys me when there's tons of stuff on the snack kitchen table, especially multiple used knives with greasy residue on them and things like that. Same for the tea sideboard. Can we please try and keep these areas tidy?
    - She's not the only one. We'll try to do better.
    - [Nathalie] It's not only the snack kitchen, let's try to keep tables generally clearer and help tidy up after meals more!
- [Matthias] Suggestion to switch to CO2 neutral gas? (EWS; would double our gas costs from ~900 to ~1800 euros per year; + increase due to likely increased heating this winter). Should we contact EWS for a discount? https://www.ews-schoenau.de/biogas/
    - Our financial situation is much better now, so we could afford it.
    - Doug will do some reasearch and present his outcomes on Slack. Then we decide next week.
    - [Tilmann] our usage was lower last year, it was 600€ in the 2018-2019 winter.
- [Matthias] Wants to put a ventilation hole in K20-1 office.
    - It will use the chimney in the dining room.
    - No resistance.
- [Janina] Require people coming from the street to take off their (dirty) shoes before they enter living areas?
    - No resistance, some concerns of how to use it.
    - We should go through the house shoe drawer and sort out shitty ones.
    - We will tell people who come in to take off their shoes - especially if they ask. Good enough for now.
    - Many edge cases we didn't even treat: People walking barefoot in summer, people using house shoes in the garden, etc.
- [Janina] Constitutional change
    - Small changes are okay, maybe even better. Janina will push forward with it then.
- [chandi] Are all trees in the garden free to take?
    - [Janina] They took the 4 trees we agreed upon, this will be all for now.
- [matthias] Shower head experience?
    - It's great, but apparently slightly broken on the wall holder. Matthias will repair it today.
- [matthias] Glasses and cups experience?
    - Mostly good, can stay this way.
- [Matthias] new name for silvan storage
    - Yes! 
    - The (Thing/baby) bathroom
- [Matthias] There will be warm water in the baby bathroom soon! :tada:
    - [Matthias] I will start installing it on Wednesday.
- [Matthias] Internet contract - currently we would pay 46.7€/month. We could downgrade to 38.2€/month in November (would lose mobile flatrate and downgrade to 100mbit/s instead of 250)


### 7. Dinner lottery
<!-- To be done on the physical board -->

### 8. For next week
- Decide on EWS gas and if we want to ask for a discount.
