<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

#### To schedule
- Matthias evaluation
    - He'd like Doug and Bodhi to also give feedback, so we schedule dynamically

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
<!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- [Doug] Calendar: deleting one event of a repeating series seems impossible via Nextcloud web interface. Works via Thunderbird.
- [Doug] Inventaire.io+ event, 18-25 July, piano room reservation, no heavy works: any resistance?
    - Seems fine.
- [Matthias] Roof renovation progress
    - No update but want to continue. Matthias wants to write to Corinna again and push this more.
    - This could also involve spending some money to pay for a statics report.
- [Janina] Billing things. Shall we do this soon? And how to go about it?
    - We need a good process to not lose overview! Last time we failed on this...
    - Janina wants more input to feel empowered to bill whenever fitting.
    - Matthias is happy to hold a presentation about this but would prefer more people being here to benefit from it.
    - Will be scheduled for next week.
- [Matthias] bank account access for move
    - Some slight concerns. Matthias has responsibility. No resistance.
- [Silvan] kindergarten pickup
    - Janina and Tilmann go.
- [Matthias] tile unloading
    - Today at 2 pm.
- [Janina] Do we do something for Easter? Compare internatoional traditions like the Czech one where Women get beaten with sticks... ^^'
    - Not enough enthusiasm to schedule anything, will be decided spontaneously.
- [Silvan] We need to wash 5 bags of food!

### 7. For next week
- [Matthias] Presentation on billing
