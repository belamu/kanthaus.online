#### To schedule


### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) 
<!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- [Matthias] Presentation on billing
- [findus] bought non vegan food agreement in collective agreements?
    - General interest in the discussion and in having clear labels
    - The exact phrasing is important because this is a tricky topic and there are tons of nuances
    - We don't want to make it bigger than it is, but we also don't want to encourage overusage of bought products because of a lack of awareness
    - Many different aspects: Bought animal products vs. bought products in general; privately bought things vs. communnaly bought things; 
- [findus, matthias] Gesundheitsamt/Lebensmittelaufsicht war da, wie gehen wir damit um und wer geht gleich zum Termin?
    - She seems quite friendly and it could be fine just talking a bit.
    - Matthias and Thore will go.
- [Matthias] Wupphour kitchen wall this week?
    - Seal off garden side of kitchen with plastic?
    - Planning meeting on Tuesday morning, prep work on Tuesday, dirty work on Wednesday
- [Tilmann] Steuererklärung til end of May
    - [matthias] no, until 31.07.2019 or if we ask until 28.2.2020
- [Silvan] Do we have a unused uSD-Card (fast, >=32GB)? The Communal-Sleeping-Cinema-Raspberry needs one. Otherwise I would buy one.
    - chandi will have a look
