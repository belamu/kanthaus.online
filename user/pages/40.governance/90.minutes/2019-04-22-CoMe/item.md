<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

#### To schedule


### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
<!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->
- [Nathalie] Sommerfest: we don't have a date yet - how do we progress? also happy to talk about it this afternoon
- [Doug] Evaluation proposals: 1) to not have food during evaluations 2) to decide time-keeper/facilitator when scheduling evaluation 3) to have a default slot for evaluations on Thursday afternoons.
    - General agreement.
- [Clara] Solawi
    - Clara is in contact with Rote Beete to find out what conditions they'd offer for us. She'll keep us updated.
- [Clara] XR discussion
    - Informal round at or after dinner tonight..? Seems the only valid option right now.
- [Doug] Patafix: proposal to use it on walls instead of tape. (pack costs €2.50 from Rossman, which is as cheap as ebay)
    - Patafix/bluetack is not eternally resuable, people should still take care when attaching (is the surface clean?) and removing (slow and careful), but the general experience is much better than with tape.
    - No resistance.
- [Doug] Logo proposal: start a 'final' ukuvota (i.e. we use the result) today, with 1 week for proposals and decision (because people seem busy)
    - Doug will go forward and set the ukuvote up today.
- [Doug] Personal Project Updates proposal: have at month end/beginning when there's not roadmap (i.e. 8 times per year)
    - Clara proposes to only have personal project updates once every three months but in the middle of the roadmap.
    - There's many ways not to not have the two things conflicting. For now we try Doug's proposal.
    - If it's put into the calendar and people are made aware of it in time, it should work out nicely.
- [Silvan] Next weekend there might be an acroyoga event at Störmthaler See. To transport the sauna and stuff I would like to use the KMW. More details will be planned this week. (If it is Störmthaler See, you are also invited.)
    - KMW is probably not needed for anything else during this time.
    - No resistance.
- [Janina] On Saturday there's World Disco Soup Day and the Slow Food Youth group in Leipzig organizes an event for the occasion. I will definitely go there and I'm happy about anybody who'd like to join! :)
- [Silvan] I would like to do a Gartenhaus-Entrümpelaktion this week and would need one or two helpers and the KMW for this. Tuesday or Wednesday morning?
    - Tuesday is not good because of Open Tuesday opening. Wednesday is more realistic. Need to talk in person again.


### 7. For next week
- [Matthias] Presentation on billing
