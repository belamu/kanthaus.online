<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- [doug] https://codi.kanthaus.online/gas Decide on EWS gas and if we want to ask for a discount.
    - people interested should look at the pad and then discuss, decision next come?!
- [matthias] would like to order Fugendichtband to try to seal some doors, maybe windows, especially of sleeping rooms (Private, Sleep Kitchen, Hipster, Office<->Living, K22-1 main door). https://www.fugendichtband24.de/EPDM-Zellkautschuk-einseitig-selbstklebend-10m-Rolle-2mm-x-diverse-Breiten.htm Would get 1, 2, 3 and 4 mm thickness, 10mm width, 10m length. ~20€ including shipping and should be sufficient for ~4 doors then.
    - no concerns or resistance
- [michal] would like to borrow a few pieces of clothes from communal closet for 5-day Leipzig trip (underwear, some chill clothes)
    - for sure
- [matthias] registered some stuff so we can employ people with wandel wuerzen. The process seems quite easy (max. a few hours the first time).
- [lise] winter is coming and christmas as well! Lise will put out the Adventskalender for this year and remind people in November to fill it.
- [matthias] winter is coming. Please keep windows closed and rooms anti-moisture-ventilated
- [lise] outcome money-focused sharing-circle in git: https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/blob/master/meetings/internal/2019-10-25-money-sharing-circle
    - proposal:
        - every CoMe a section about needs and what people would maybe buy (to see if somebody has alternatives, connections,...)
        - every first CoMe per month maybe a slackbot who tells us about last expenses
- [matthias] Request: XR IT weekend on 09./10.11. with up to 15, realistically 5-10 people in Kanthaus?. Mostly offline work/onboarding/socialising
    - agreement that it can/should take place in KH
- [matthias] buy more smoke detectors. How many? (Officially: All sleeping rooms and exit ways. Logically: All rooms where a fire might start undetected (e.g. empty room or sleeping people))
    - count the number of rooms missing a smoke detector and order the right amount
    - suggestion to make a fire plan [Doug]
    - suggestion to put signs for fire extinguishers
    - Doug and Lise would be interested to talk about this further
- [silvan] did we get money from UJ for their meetings here this year?
    - probably not, Matthias writes an email to state our feelings. For the team meeting of the next uj?! we should make it more clear from the beginning and also talk about how it felt last year for us.
- [matthias] would have wanted to clean the heating system burner, but we might want to switch it on very soon.
    - will do it soon. Better now then when it is really cold and then something breaks :)
    - (all went well without breaking)
- [Silvan] Plan of KMW Repair? rear wheel loses Bremsflüssigkeit.
    - [bodhi] will do a work on rear wheel today
    - (unfortunately it takes a bit more... would be ~300-400€ in workshop, thinking about doing it in Harzgerode)
- [Silvan] harvest all Gemüse from the garden until frost
    - artificial tomato ripening
    - [lise] looks for and harvests pumpkins
- [matthias] CNC drill bits
    - will be talked about next Monday (price, more info after research)
- [silvan] transparency for non-present members about spoken things
    - Idea: create a kh signal group?
