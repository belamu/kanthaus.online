<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning
- Sushi. Don't take too much, it spoils easily! Have a close look before eating - especially at the avocado pieces!
- There still is a pit of chopped veggies, which really need to be cooked!
- Bodhi would like to make a BBQ sometime this week.
- Feuerzangenbowle on Thursday will need some food preparation.

### 7. Heating planning
- Cloud room for having calls (today)
- Living room cozily
- Kitchen similar
- Snack kitchen as mold counter measure
- Bathroom to 12°C
- Right now the heating runs from 7:30 am to 10:00 pm, which could be too long..?
- General heating periods will be closely monitored and possibly adapted
- There is interest to do curtain research and prototyping

### 8. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Roadmap review and planning!
  - Scheduled!
- More thoughts on default heating policy
  - Functional heating (rooms that fulfill purposes no other room fulfills can be heated when needed)
  - Turn down radiators in the offices when the last one goes to bed
  - Turning down means snowflake if the room gets heated again in the next 24 hours, otherwise it's 0.
  - Always properly ventilate when you turn off a radiator! (meaning: ~5 minutes)
- undjetzt?! meeting (hosted by Matthias)
  - They probably want to use the cloud room
  - Larissa joins for food prep
- Doug is looking for a watch to wear on his arm
  - Lise has one and will give it to him
- New electronic bathroom occupancy indicator
  - Matthias wonders if there's more need for explanatory signs and stuff
  - Responses are very positive so far, just the bright light is missing - now even more, because there's a switch that doesn't work.
Thore's allergic reactions got worse since coming here and he'd like to find out more clearly what is causing it. To make this more easy Nathalie asks if it's okay to claim a room to be able to control another variable. The palm room is a hot candidate.
  - General understanding and willingness to cooperate in the round.
- Yesterday Matthias discovered mold in the upper staircase toilet. Please leave the door of this tiny room open after leaving the room!
  - Janina will remove the wallpaper close to the window.
- Doug proposed to plan one week more in advance. We could try it out and see how it works.
  - Janina thinks it would be helpful to navigate around all the recurring things more easily.

### 9. For next week
