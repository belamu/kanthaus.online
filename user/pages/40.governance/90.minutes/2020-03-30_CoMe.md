<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!) 
  - Maybe these notes helps you to do it by your own: Github-Link: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/tree/master/user/pages/40.governance/90.minutes Steps: 1) Click "Create new file" 2) Type as Name "year-months-day_CoMe/item.md" example: 2020-03-02_CoMe/item.md 3) Copy CoMe-minutes from the "Bearbeiten Modus" (black window) 4) Click "Commit changes" That´s it! After a few minutes the CoMe-minutes should appear on the website.     
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Instead of clearing the pad, you can copy over the template (https://codi.kanthaus.online/come-template) - but make sure the template is up-to-date. Also, keep everything that's relevant for next week.
  - Have fun!

### 4. Announcements
<!-- Were there any changes to governance? -->
- [Lise] the fridge in the snack kitchen is now in use. I put a sign in the hallway and thought we could test having open things to put on bread and open beverage (E.g. milks) in the fridge. 
- [matthias] Process to find out if we can remove the chimney this year already to save a bit of work on the roof: https://codi.kanthaus.online/heizungstausch (More generally about future heating strategies) Would start an ukuvote in a few weeks.
- [doug] Clip broken from gray mask because tapped too hard. Tooth from blue mask bayonet sheared off (who? how?). Please be careful with the masks! They are reusable if we treat them like reusables! Please just ask me if in doubt.
- [Lise] will sort communal closet this week. Clothes go then in the vortex. 
- [Anja] There is a lot of food to be washed, please have a look and help out!
- [Anja] I will be sewing facemasks this week to donate them. If someone wants to join me please do - no sewing skills needed!
- [Bodhi] Moisture in the snack kitchen due to heating on zero and kitchen door open - please take care to prevent this!

### 5. Shopping plans
- [Silvan] Mungbohnen and Azukibohnen from https://suessundclever.de 29.90€ (3kg + 1kg) or 23.40€ (2kg + 1kg) (organic, plastic-free packaging, from china)

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
<!-- Results to be copied on the physical board -->
- [matthias] Bauhelferunfallversicherung
  - Matthias will go ahead with it
- [doug] We seem to get a lot of house phone calls for specific individuals. How can we get people to directly contact people instead of calling the house?
  - answering the phone created a small amount of work every time, so it would be cool to give out personal numbers or be there to answer the phone yourself when awaiting a call.
- [lise] how to find out who the power hour DJ is? 
  - proposal: have a slot in CoMe where people can write them down. If nobody is there, announce that the slot is still free.
  - proposal: people think about that themselves and if nobody is prepared on thursday, there is no DJ.
  - proposal: communal playlist in case there is nobody as DJ
- [Janina] I would like to have power hour facilitation made visible as a task again. It's about reminding people the evening before to make sure they're aware, will come and put away their things, and it's about leading through the part where tasks are given out. I normally did it but I would like it to happen even when I'm not taking care of it...
  - [doug] I can do it this week.
- [matthias] bringing away building rubble this week - volunteers?
  - [tilmann] whole stones could be removed from the bags beforehand and stacked
  - [matthias] I could help loading. Disposal site is a few hundred meters north of Salzstraße 6, 04828 Machern
  - [anja] I can do that today
  - [silvan] we need soil anyway, so we could combine those tours
