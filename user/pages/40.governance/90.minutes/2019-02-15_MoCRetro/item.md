- Duration: 1 month
- Time-period: mid-Jan to mid-Feb

### Could have been better/Change

- Improve scheduling (less stress/time taken)
  - A lot of complexity came from external schedules
  - Possibly have a 'core' time which most participants try to attend.
- Have a clearer 'frame' in terms of handling day-visitors.
- Have a clearer intention of what the time should be for.
- Choose better name
- Don't have overlapping with other internal events
- Have more emotions-oriented sessions, including regular sharing circles
- Discussions haven't lead to many changes yet, and it's not sure if further changes will happen.
- Not having big events scheduled for at least one week after the end.
