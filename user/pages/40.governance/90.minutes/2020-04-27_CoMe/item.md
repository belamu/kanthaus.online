<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, solar intake, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!) 
  - Maybe these notes helps you to do it by your own: Github-Link: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/tree/master/user/pages/40.governance/90.minutes Steps: 1) Click "Create new file" 2) Type as Name "year-months-day_CoMe/item.md" example: 2020-03-02_CoMe/item.md 3) Copy CoMe-minutes from the "Bearbeiten Modus" (black window) 4) Click "Commit changes" That´s it! After a few minutes the CoMe-minutes should appear on the website.     
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Check the shoe!
  - Have fun!

### 1. Last week review

##### Daily averages for last week
<!-- Read counters in heating room and append to water.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146415 and gas.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146411. Strongly knock against the display of the solar inverter in K20 Basement material storage and put the E-Total kWh in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146414 solar.csv, take the difference between your and the last value and multiply it with 0.285 €/kWh and divide by 7 days to have the solar intake per day. update the residence record (https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/blob/master/residenceRecord.csv) otherwise the script will complain -->

### 4. Announcements
<!-- Were there any changes to governance? -->
- [Bodhi] e-bike status update: we have one working bettery (does about 10-20km), that can be stored directly on the ebike when full, or in the workshop charging station for charging. Other battery is WIP. You need a key to attach/remove the battery. There are 2 keys for this in the keyshelf.
- [Doug] Lots of solar stuff in front of water counter makes access difficult. Could responsible-feelers rearrange that?
- [Matthias] Foodsharing hackweek schedule: https://codi.kanthaus.online/foodsharing-hackweek
- [Anja] There's food to be washed.
- [Felix] The washing machine works again.

### 5. Shopping plans
- Lots of wood, still
- [Bodhi] 10€ of phone credit (see discussion)

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Janina] communal meals & food lottery: how to continue
    - Outcome of Friday talk to continue with Dinner. However, that doesn't mean that's the 'final outcome'.
    - A small group will continue with preparin an ukuvote so that we can have something about how we do communal meals in the collective agreements at some point.
    - We want to do this right and have a productive process that clarifies the issue.
- [Bodhi] taking a bike to Harzgerode for 2-3 weeks (preferece: 1. matrix, 2. Union), also 2 bike bags (which ones?)
    - janina is unclear, will talk to bodhi after come
- [Lise] I also want to take a bike in a week or so, preference: ebike
    - [nathalie] thore and I also thought about doing a bike trip in may, but then quite a lot of bike would be gone...
    - [silvan] if people want to take bikes for longer can't they spend time to fix bikes instead of taking the best ones..?
    - [janina] we should have a separate bike meeting to figure out which bikes can/should go where in the next weeks
- [maxime] do we assume that rancidification is the fate that awaits all nuts in the storage, and all restrictions should be left? I'm thinking of the big box of nuts below the table near the window.
    - [lise] it was mostly about the walnuts and cashews in the jam shelf, not about the others.
    - [bodhi] in general I'd say just eat the nuts. I asked findus and didn't get an answer.
    - [doug] I will contact findus again to get more clarity and not accidentally offend her.b
- [Matthias] Dishwasher default program changed from Spar to Universal Plus. Do people have a feeling if it kept dishes more clean (+25% Energy (1.05->1.35 kWh), +30% water usage (13->17 liters))?
    - seems to be worth it
- [Bodhi] Sperrmülltour, local Wurzen place
    - larissa and maxime 'volunteer' ;p
- [Bodhi] mobile phone calling from landline
    - small group topic
- [Matthias] CoMe stats not working almost every week since a few weeks
    - [tilmann] it always has different reasons, this time it was because grafana is down and janina renamed nun only in the resrec and not the evrec. also when you pass by the server it's possible to disconnect the network plug.
    - [matthias] it is fragile in many ways
    - [doug] I'm interested in fixing the physical fragility of the network plug

### 7. Lunch lottery/food recommendation
Run lottery: https://kanthaus.gitlab.io/dinner-lottery/
<!-- Results to be copied on the physical board -->

### 8. For next week
- [Doug] volunteer to clean the reservation sheets?
