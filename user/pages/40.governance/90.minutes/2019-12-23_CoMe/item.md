<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Changes to Governance
- [doug] Ongoing: Proposals open for another couple of hours: https://ukuvota.world/#/app/7f854bb8-d361-c232-d84e-c85d82457797/collect

### 7. Expense Requests
- Bodhi wants to buy a compressor at some point
- Bodhi wants to buy board & permanent marker ink in various colors, plus maybe other office material
- Janina might buy an electric milk pump at some point

### 8. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Lise] Some people talked about a new sharing format to solve conflicts or topics that are too bid / not fitting in sharing circles and evaluations. Like the social Sauna they do in harzgerode.
    - [janina] still thinks it's a good idea to try it out. (+1 bodhi) but makes more sense when more people are here.
    - [tilmann] I already proposed it for the day we talked about it. Am still in favor.
- [Lise] Would be cool if people could write down their wishes and expectations about the month of introspection. What about extending this period of time? There were thoughts about focused working time or one week without any meeting. 
    - [janina] will start a pad. Please add your thoughts: https://codi.kanthaus.online/monthOfIntrospection
- [bodhi] What about the problem of throwing away things vs. being annoyed about losing things.
    - [tilmann] There's the vortex of doom concept which is basically three rotating boxes. Every week the last box is emptied and the stuff inside is thrown away or put to the free shop.
    - [bodhi] I'm afraid that people will always put things out again, that would demotivate me a lot.
    - [janina] We could require people to put their names on the things they save back. That would mean they have to take care of them then.
