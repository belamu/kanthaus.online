<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

##### Things that happened
- Bodhi, Nathalie, Janina and Chandi attended a dd lawsuit in Leipzig
- Nathalie had a long and pleasant chat with Bejnarowicz and his brother-in-law at the market pickup
- Silvan brought quite some stuff from Auerworld and put most of it in his storage house
- Max harvested a lot of Mirabelles, some of which were unripe (we should not do that again!)
- Tilmann extended the free shop storage shelf
- The regular internet connection was lost on Saturday. For now we have a hotspot and a SIM card
- There was intense rain and hail on Saturday

### 4. Evaluations and check-in

- *Bodhi* _Member_ : _Absolute Days_ threshold 192/180
- *Findus* _Volunteer_ : _Absolute Days_ threshold 98/60
- *Michal* _Volunteer_ : _Absolute Days_ threshold 95/60

People are coming and going and there seems to be no good times for evaluations. It's maybe okay though, we can do them in later August...

#### To schedule

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- Internet should be back on Friday, right? Anything we need to do about that?
    - plug in Fritzbox again, update gateway setting on dragon-k20-1 (Tilmann will do it)
- Sharing event: last week retrospective
    - there still seems to be no good frame
    - communal sleeping room sharing was not ideal (people were tired, it felt a bit awkward to imitate such a normally natural situation)
    - nathalie finds it generally sad that it happens so rarely. she's interested in putting more energy in coming up with a good structure in two weeks or so. could start with a meeting to share ideas with other people.
- foosharing festival after meeting here? Nathalie and Thore consider it and will keep us updated. Potential dates are the last weekend of August or the first of September.

### 7. Water/Dinner lottery

### 8. For next week
