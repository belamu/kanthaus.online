### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- [Clara via Tilmann] announce Open Tuesday summer break; draw a sign to put on K22 door
    - [Janina] Judging from the doodle the first reasonable time to open again is August 20.
    - [Clara] Why not just make the summer break for two months? It's easy to communicate and then we can have a grand reopening with cake again.
    - [Janina] We need to ask Nathalie, I'll do it when she comes back tomorrow.
- [Janina] I'd like to make the matrix bike into open property (meaning: call it 'mine' and care about it but still have it in the shed and free to use for everyone if I don't need it). What's the process for this? Would be cool to have one... ;)
    - It's a bigger topic than to be discussed in CoMe, there will be casual talks this week and hopefully a more formal meeting in the end of August.
    - There are concerns about privatizing communal stuff, but also about our bike system not working. It's definitely an important topic.
- [chandi] can someone finally fix the evaluation record parsing?
    - nobody
- [Anja] There is way too much life in the black bin and it's only half full. What to do about it?
    - Fill it up with stuff and get it emptied tomorrow. Tilmann will take care.
    - Then store it next to the compost to have it out of the sun.
    - On top of that we should more careful in trying to not create rest waste in the first place.
