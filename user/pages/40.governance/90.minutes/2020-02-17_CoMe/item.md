<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 5. Announcements
- [lise] Max (Friend of mine) will come and host the pen&paper (Dsa) 28.02-01.03. He sent a mail with information, please read it if interested. He'd like to prepare our characters before 20.02, if you're interested we could create them together in a session. So far I know of Bodhi, tilmann, nathalie and Janina that they'd like to play.
- [maxime] We came to an agreement on Inventaire hack week dates: 12/05 -> 18/05
- [janina] It's likely that the market stand on Jacobsplatz comes back this month. Keep your eyes open for it if you take a walk on a Wednesday or Saturday, please!
- [doug] please do not leave things, especially wet things, on the soap holders. Broken soap → broken soap jar. There are now ~10 pieces of pre-capped soap.
- [Lise] There is a lot of food to be washed (5 boxes)
- [janina] I made a MoI overview pad: https://codi.kanthaus.online/MoI2020?edit
- [matthias] Tilmann and me will start the carla cargo workshop this week
- [doug] names on MOI cards _please_
- [Bodhi] Festool sponsoring

### 6. Changes to Governance
- none

### 7. Expense Requests
- €2.50 for 1m * 75mm pipe for soap forming https://www.rhg.de/baustoffe-wurzen/ht-rohr-nw-75-1000mm (I've looked quite a lot, and couldn't find one) [Doug]
    - approved!
- 4 * 3m 7502 @12€ each plus 20€ for filters/caps = 70€ -> 10 masks [doug]
    - doug will write up some details and bring it into come again next week
- 6 slice Dualit toaster. Upper limit for ebay sniping requested. (previous discussion https://yunity.slack.com/archives/CT0K2AY87/p1579958133002700) [Doug]
    - [matthias] Would like to know if anybody seconds ~~the strong need for~~ getting another toaster? I am happy with the 4 slice one...
    - [doug] Current toaster: 4 slices only (wasting powere when less than fully used). Better toaster: 2, 4 or 6 slices
        - [matthias] small toaster: 800W, big one: 1200W. 90 seconds for a toast load makes 0.01 kWh wasted energy per toast, 1 kWh=0.30ct -> for 300 toast loads you save 1 euro (how to calculate our CO2-neutral electricity vs. producing a toaster?)
        - [matthias] I only have slight concerns, no resistance. Please go ahead.

### 8. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [lise] Felix (Dresden) would like to come On 9.03 and stay for ~3 weeks. Host?
   - Tilmann and Janina will host
- [anja] KH instagram account? Who would also be interested in taking care of it?
   - Social Media Phone? (i.e. dedicated phone with decent camera to install sm apps)
       - general positive responses
   - Use cool alternative platforms at the same time
       - general positive responses (with unknown amount of work)
- (Moved from 'other things that happened by Doug') new data structure implemented and a lot of files got sorted [chandi]
    * kanthaus-public (cloud) https://kanthaus.online/public
    * kanthaus-governance (gitlab) https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-governance
    * kanthaus-private (gitlab) https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private
    * kanthaus-photos (cloud, private)
    * kanthaus-temp (cloud, private)
        - [doug] data rearrangement: 1) Would Chandi like to present changes in greater detail? 2) quite a lot of things I think should be private are now in kanthaus-public... I don't want to sort through now: move everything to private just now?
        - [tilmann] there still seem to be some bugs
           - stats not working, tries to pull resourcesUsed from kanthaus-public
           - I couldn't the weekly script to run on my local machine, complains about HTTP404

    - Plan no new events until roof building time scheduled
