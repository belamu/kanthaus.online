<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

#### To schedule


### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc) <!-- can also include discussions about cooking and heating -->

- [Clara] Idea: "Logo"-decision: Set a date, and then vote over logo on that day via ukuvota. Prepare and design logos until then, have 2 feedback sessions in between?
    - [Doug] So far only Silvan, Doug, Laurina and Clara active in discussion on #kantkunst. Anyone else particularly interested? Interested people could just work in that channel and see if they find agreement. (I was v. close to just applying one of the logos I made already :)
- [Doug] Please put your name on signs you make, especially if you expect other people to obey them: allows people to debate things they disagree with.
- [Nathalie] reading session: Nathalie wants to read out loud "im meer schwimmen krokodile". maybe 4 1-h-sessions for the whole book. Who is interested? only Kanthaus or make it a public event?
- [Nathalie] Kanthaus Sommerfest?
- [Nathalie] monthly update of info box outside
- [Doug] I will deal with chaos I started in k22 staircase
- [Lise] Kanthaus Kleingarten?
- [Nick] missing sharing circle notifications (Slack)
- [matthias] thanks to laurina we have a new whiteboard/pinwall (look to the left of the kitchen door!)
