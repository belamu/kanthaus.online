<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, solar intake, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!) 
  - Maybe these notes helps you to do it by your own: Github-Link: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/tree/master/user/pages/40.governance/90.minutes Steps: 1) Click "Create new file" 2) Type as Name "year-months-day_CoMe/item.md" example: 2020-03-02_CoMe/item.md 3) Copy CoMe-minutes from the "Bearbeiten Modus" (black window) 4) Click "Commit changes" That´s it! After a few minutes the CoMe-minutes should appear on the website.     
  - As soon as the minutes are online, post the link to the #Kanthaus channel on slack and empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Check the shoe!
  - Have fun!

##### Daily averages for last week
<!-- Read counters in heating room and append to water.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146415 and gas.csv in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146411. Strongly knock against the display of the solar inverter in K20 Basement material storage and put the E-Total kWh in https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/146414 solar.csv, take the difference between your and the last value and multiply it with 0.285 €/kWh and divide by 7 days to have the solar intake per day. update the residence record (https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/blob/master/residenceRecord.csv) otherwise the script will complain -->

### 4. Announcements
<!-- Were there any changes to governance? -->
- [silvan] please close the event storage door after leaving the room because of dust reasons
- [lise] We got a lot of new food, including buckets full of salad dressing, remoulade and Feinkost-Salate. Also fish and vacuumed potatoes with ham. It's all in the basement and should be kept in mind (eat & distribute it!). If you open a big bucket and it's likely that we won't finish it in the next days, please refill some of it, mark the open bucket and put it back in the basement or try to offer it to friends of us. 
- [lise] In the bike talk we decided on me taking the e-bike to Harzgerode. It will not be here for max. two weeks. We agreed, that the bike has great potential and we will have further talks about deciding if it can't be taken out of KH for longer trips. But since that is a future discussion people think it's okay when I take it for now.
- [lise] There is now a folder in the nextcloud where we can put all pictures that are nice-looking and okay for publishing: https://cloud.kanthaus.online/f/157612
- [matthias] There is now slack reminders for paper and bio müll (we forgot it last week...) at 4pm the day before it happens.

### 5. Shopping plans

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc.)
- [Doug] I will take on the task of cleaning the room reservation sheets after CoMe. I would ask people to not to make reservations before 12:00. I would treat the task like the residency-record-updater: happy to pass it on, and would try to pass it on if I can't do it.
    - Thanks Doug!
- [matthias] what's up with the light situation in yoga room? It seemed to be very dark.
    - [silvan] I exchanged it. There is a special mandala light now.
    - [matthias] But it's very dark in the room now.
    - [silvan] well it could still be improved. I can take care.
- [Anja] do we accept toxic plants in the garden? Plant some of them or keep the current ones? Who cares about that?
  - [felix] you could put signs to the toxic plants, couldn't you?
  - [anja] it's a bit tricky in the parts of the garden where it's a bit wild. but I could make a map and mark on there where we have plants which you shouldn't eat.
  - [lise] I have concerns to planting new highly toxic plants if it's just for the reason that they look nice.
  - [clara] my main concern is kids eating them because they don't know better.
  - [anja] I'll take care then to remove the ones growing closely to the paths next year and not plants new toxic plants just now. you can talk to me about further details.
- [Felix] Bike Sale: What are the goals?
  - Wednesday: bike storage sale in the garden
  - Empty the attic of bikes. -> move into empty shed afterwards
  - Agree on bikes to disassemble. -> mark & move into shed & disassemble soon
  - Check if the best bikes are in the bike shed -> Find out who can use which bike [seems not that important]
  - Be aware of which bikes are worth fixing
    - No list of missing parts, did not work in past
  - [Doug] unwanted bikes could be stored in.waste area as metal waste
- [silvan] i lost my long micro-usb-cable + charger somewhere in the house, has someone seen it?
- [Doug] I think it doesnt make sense to schedule stuff without info about it... either short intro or schedule in discussion?
    - valid point
    - [janina] we could generally put the discussion before the scheduling part
    - [matthias] how about trying it out? -> facilitator decides
    - [nathalie] I wouldn't feel comfortable to make every scheduling point a discussion because some things are just clear.
- [larissa] which bike to use for the trip on Wednesday/Thursday
- [clara] pictures wwf/articles generally -> which ones are okay to use?
    - lise's folder is a great solution!
    - people who don't want to be in published pictures can remove the pics from the folder
    - [doug] there was a thread on slack about this and some people stated that they don't want to appear in published fotos
    - [clara] we could make a file in the folder to store such information
    - [felix] it's a difference as to where stuff is published, if it's facebook or instagram or just the fluter magazine
    - [doug] I guess people's picture preferences will be as complicated as their dietary requirements...^^
