### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc.)
- Funding money for Fahrradreparaturstation arrived

    - Tilmann points out that Dehnitz is not next door and that we can also benefit from such a station
    - Matthias is interested in getting involved as well
- Report from meta roadmap meeting
    - minutes/summary on Slack
    - Schedule Jahresplanungstreffen/MCM?
    - people are interested, scheduling is a bit tricky since we want to have a lot of people participating
    - we'll see again next week what makes sense
    - 1st of October as latest fallback option
    - Tilmann makes a dudle

    - tiny meeting directly after CoMe for everybody interested (max 15 mins)
- Sommerfest: 21.09 or 28.09?
    - last meeting has minutes on Slack (KiFa idea)
    - 28th is best time, we really hope that Silvan can make it too
- buckets from the Dönerladen can be picked up
    - they seem to have yellow sacks collected a day or two before we do
    - people can basically always stop by there and collect some buckets, or wait for the maximum bucket chance and got take them all
    - background: we still need way more buckets to safely store the dry food we got!
- Results of the Month of Introspection ukuvote - do we have a decision?
    - Yes: all of February is closed for visitors and groups
    - We can discuss further what exactly we do and if we wanto to add more events.

- Wupphours
    - meta meeting or pause until MCM?
    - decide from week to week depending on motivation
- Lise brought her bike and put it in the shed. She's undecided how she wants it to be used since it has emotional value.
    - bike situation gets harder and harder - people are unsatisfied with the current system
    - a bike meta meeting is needed, but won't happen this week
- [matthias] short wifi update
    - summary on Slack
