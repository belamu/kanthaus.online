### Coordination Meeting
We meet on Mondays at 10:00 to distribute information, make plans and generally coordinate. All residents are recommended to join.

### Power Hour
We meet on Thursdays at 10:00 to briefly plan what communal cleaning needs to be done, and then clean for an hour. This is in addition to ordinary cleaning, not a replacement. All residents are recommended to join.

### Heart Sharing Circle
We usually meet on Wednesdays at 17:00 to share feelings in a safe space. There may or may not be a facilitator and if no group comes together to share, the circle does not happen.

### Hosting Duty
Hosts—Volunteers or Members which agree to host a Visitor—are responsible for taking care that their Visitor and the other residents have the best time possible. This responsibility includes tour-guiding, question answering, helping to avoid common problems and resolving tensions. Hosts are also responsible for organizing a check-in for the Visitor after the Visitor has spent ~7 days at Kanthaus. The check-in round is an informal chat in which the Visitor, their host and one or two Volunteers/Members see how things are going for the Visitor and other residents. Hosting Duty should be explicitly transferred if the current host leaves for more than 2 or 3 days.

### Quiet Hours
We want everyone to be able to sleep well. A general guideline is to be as quiet as possible between 00:00 and 07:00, especially (near to) where people sleep K20-2 and K22-2. Only do loud things between 09:00 and 21:00. Significant deviations to this guideline should be proposed in advance, preferably at the Coordination Meeting.

### Clear Table Policy
Please help keep the shared table space as usable as possible. In general, clear space as soon as you are finished. If you need to leave things on a table, try do so in a way that leaves as much space for others (e.g. stack papers on top of your laptop.) The living room and main kitchen tables should always be left clear: don't leave these table with anything on them and wipe unless very clean.

### Clear Windowsill Policy
Every room needs at least one window that can be easily opened: please do not leave anything on the windowsill that is currently clear.

### Don't break the windows
Please use the window holders. If there isn't a window holder or if it's not possible to use it, don't leave it unattended or find another way to prevent it from slamming.

### Smoking
Do not smoke at all within the buildings. If you smoke outside, please ensure that smoke does not come in through open doors or windows. Do not throw cigarette butts on the ground! They can be disposed of in the black bin in the garden.

### Alcohol
Kanthaus is not a bar: please do not come here with drinking as a primary purpose and be aware that alcohol consumption will not be considered as an excuse or justification of behavior. That said, responsible alcohol consumption is tolerated. Please contact a Volunteer or Member with concerns or questions regarding this topic.
